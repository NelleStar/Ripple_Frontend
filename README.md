Ripple is a social media site that is quickly become a long term project. My goal is to have a fully functional social media site where a user can hang out without having to feel like they are interacting at all times.

https://github.com/NelleStar/Ripple_Frontend

Currently, users are able to log in and create waves on their profile page or the waves feed. Each wave can be commented on and updated as needed. Users can feel confident that their private information is secure thanks to bcrypt hashing of passwords.

Using Node and express backends the database is set up update and delete information as the user updates their profiles and waves. Express Router and insomnia calls allowed me to find ways to grab the information I needed at any given time.

create-react-app was used for the front end, allowing me to build reusable components, forms, hooks and the like. CSS was used for some light design work but most of the focus remains at this time on the backhalf of the front end and the backend server to ensure it runs smoothly.

Jest tests are being built and implemented still, working my way from the backend to the front end.

Currently a user can login or sign up and then peruse the site. Waves, or the user feed, can be viewsed as a community on the waves page or as individual contributions on the individuals profile page. Users can  update their information on their profile page along with updating photos.

The next step in Ripple is to implement photo albums. A place where a user can keep memories and rotate the album covers to keep their profiles as unique as they are.

Finally Ripple will include a music source for tracks to play while a user is on their homepage. What says "this is me" more than our favorite songs?

All in all, Ripple took on a life of its own. and when I started it I didn't know how big it would get. This became much more than a capstone to me. Now I have a long term project that feels like something I can continue to improve upon.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
